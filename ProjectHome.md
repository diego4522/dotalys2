This is a application to parse and visualise the replay files of the popular MOBA game Dota2. It allows you to extract descriptive statistics such as number of deaths, gold accumulated etc. from a single match. It also features the ability to read the so called packet entities, i.e. provides you with spatial coordinates for most events.

Disclaimer: features are only implemented as I needed them for a research project, and the code in this repository should generally be considered as "research" level quality code.

Acknowledgements should go to git user dschleck for his C++ parser library for Dota2: https://github.com/dschleck/edith and Valve for making Dota2 of course.

**Note:** I'm adding features and changes more frequently than I update that link above. If you're fit in Java, you should really check out the source instead.
